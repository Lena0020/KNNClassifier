# KNNClassifier
Mini-project: k-NN The goal is to implement the k-NN classifier. The program should take 3 arguments: k: positive natural number being the k-NN hiperparameter. train-set: name of the file containing csv train set. test-set: name of the file containing csv test set. Requirements: The program should apply k-NN classifier based on the train set to each vector from the test set and produce the accuracy (proportion of correctly classified examples from the test set). The program should additionally provide a simple interface (not necessarily graphical) to enable the user to input single vectors to be classified. Test the program using training data in iris.data and test data in iris.test.data. Important: the program should be able to load any dataset (in a format similar to iris.data), with an arbitrary number of dimensions/classes.
